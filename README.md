# Fine-grained-Causal-Reasoning
We introduce a novel fine-grained causal reasoning dataset and present a series of novel tasks in NLP, from causality detection to event causality extraction and Causal QA. 

Our dataset contains human annotations of 25K cause-effect event pairs and 24K question-answering pairs within multi-sentence samples.

We consider three useful fine-grained causalities:
1) Cause
2) Enable
3) Prevent
